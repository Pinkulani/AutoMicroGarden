This is the code for the Microcontroller part of a Automatic Watering system for a garden!

The Microcontroller used:
- STM32 Nucleo 64 L152RE for testing/learning
- AZDelivery D1 R32 for finishing the Project

IDE used:
Arduino IDE 2.1.0

Microcontroller should be interchangable the only thing that might be a problem is getting the PINs right.
And installing and using the Arduino IDE for compiling might bring some problems.
Both boards need their respective Libraries installed.


NOTE: The Project would only compile on macOS and Windows after tinkering with settings (IDE uses deprecated Python 2) and changing the upload speed to 115200
